## Drinks

Some fruits can be turned into juices by compacting them in a basin together with water & sugar

Alcohol beverages, like wine & beer can be fermented using a [maturing barrel](#maturing-barrel)


## Maturing Barrel

The maturing barrel is a new multiblock structure, created similar to the fluid tank or the item vault.
It can store liquids and will slowly ferment some of them.

## Structures

This mod adds two village structures, where you can find the new materials and drinks

## Mod Compatibility

There is integration for a few mods if they are present:

- All disabled content is automatically hidden from [JEI][JEI]
- All recipes including the [maturing barrel](#maturing-barrel) can be viewed in [JEI][JEI]
- If present, the hops from [thermal cultivation][THERMAL_CULTIVATION] can be used to brew beer
- Any mod that adds barley will enable the recipe for the darker guinness beer
- All drinks work together with the [Tough as Nails][TAN]
- If [Tough as Nails][TAN] is loaded, purified water is needed to create juices instead of normal water (can be disabled)
